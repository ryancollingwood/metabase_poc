# metabaserow_poc
mucking about with the baserow and metabase python libaries

## why
- Metabase being a free form structured data entry tool - ala Airtable
- Baserow being a business intelligence / data biz tool - ala Tableau

Combine these with some other goodies (data integration tooling) and you have the flexibility of semi-structured data entry, but with some guarantees, and data viz.
